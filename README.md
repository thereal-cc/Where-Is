# Where-Is?

A simple Javascript program to find a file on your computer.

## How to use

This program can be used via npx or by installing it globally. Here's the general usage:  

```bash
npx where-is <filename> [directory]
```

In this example, "filename" will be replaced by the file you're searching for, while[directory] will be the folder you'll start searching in (defaults to the root directory, which will take longer).
