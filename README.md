# Where-Is?

A simple Javascript program to find a file on your computer.

## How to use

This program can be used via npx, installing it globally, or downloading the project and running it locally. Here's the general usage for npx:  

```bash
npx where-is <filename> [directory]
```

In this example, "filename" will be replaced by the file you're searching for, while [directory] will be the folder you'll start searching in (defaults to the root directory, which will take longer).
